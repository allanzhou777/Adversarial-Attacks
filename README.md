###Intro: 
In this experiment, in which we used a robust, pre-trained neural network to classify medical images, namely breast ultrasounds, brain tumor scans, and Covid-19 lung scans, we found that under certain conditions, a robust pre-trained model could outperform a non-robust pre-trained model in various aspects.

This project was made using the (robustness)[https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness] package, which helps with training and evaluating neural networks, specifically those with an emphasis on adversarial robustness.
